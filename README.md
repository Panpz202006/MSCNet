One - Abstract:
    This paper proposes the Context Enhanced Network (CENet). In the encoder stage, CENet retains low-level detail information, providing essential detail information for the final prediction results. In the decoder stage, MSC extracts multi-scale information through multiple dilation rates and different sizes to focus on both local and global information. Dynamic edge enhancement (EE) is achieved to reduce the impact of blurred edges on the final results. CF is used to fuse high-level semantic information and low-level detail information. To evaluate the effectiveness of CENet, we conducted experiments on the ISIC2018, ISIC2017, and PH2 dataset.

Two - experiment setting:
1.The introduction of models:
 (1)CNN_* are CNN-based models. Mamba_* are Mamba-based models.

2.Prepare datasetsï¼š
 (1)Push datastes to the data folder.
 (2)The datasets link are as follows:
      ISIC2017: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2017 
      ISIC2018: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018
      PH2: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/epzcoqeyr1v9qlv/PH2Dataset.rar?rlkey=6mt2jlvwfkditkyg12xdei6ux&e=1
 (3)Note: Alter your dataset path according to dataset/datasets.py.

3.Run codes:
 (1)Enter the main function, and then run it. 

4.The introduction of python files:
 (1)main.py: the entrance function of programs.
 (2)train.py: train model.
 (3)utils/lossfunction: get_metrics function is used for calculating metrics.
 (4)Note: If your data path is different with the operation of  dataset/dataset.py, you can alter the code relating dataset path in dataset/dataset.py.
